# EmbeddedLab_FinalProject
This project develops an ultrasonic distance-monitoring system using an STM32 NUCLEO-F411RE microcontroller. The system provides real-time proximity feedback through an RGB LED and buzzer. An ESP32 module enables Wi-Fi connectivity and hosts a webpage for remote monitoring of sensor data. this is on readme
